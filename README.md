# SIR.b Exercises

This is a collection of simple exercises for Arduino and Processing.

I intended to make the pong minigame so that it uses Discord API (flood incoming).
But instead, it insults you whenever you hit the ball with the paddle

  * `arduino/captor`
  * `arduino/led-management`
  * `processing/pong` : pong game, which displays an insult every time the ball touches the paddle
  * `processing/led_control` : makes a led blink with random intervals
  * `processing/simple_measure` : simple program to get a raw analog measure in Processing
